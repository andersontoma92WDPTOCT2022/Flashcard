# Welcome to [Flash Cards](https://andersontoma92wdptoct2022.github.io/Flashcard/)

## Motivation

As part of Ironhack course, this is our **first deliverable project**!

We were assigned to work in pair and deliver a game in 4 days.

One of the creators studies Japanese and the game serves to memorize the thousands of ideograms in the language.

## Technical Requirements

1.  Render a game in the browser.
2.  Have logic for winning and/or losing and show feedback to the player in either case.
3.  Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
4.  Use plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation (or HTML canvas for graphics).
5.  Have a repo on GitHub.
6.  Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
7.  Be deployed online using GitHub Pages so that anybody can play it.
8.  Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.

## Project Presentation

To start:
